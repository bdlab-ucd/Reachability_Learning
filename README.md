# Reachability_Learning
This prograimplements a learning-based framework for reachability learning having two modules: 
1) sampling pair of nodes with most reachability information
2) reachability learning. 
Our main contribution is to show that our framework is efficient, adaptive and flexible to use different methods to sample the pair of nodes with most reachability information; i.e., the first module.
To this end, we propose an approximate version of representative reachability processing algorithms in each category.
Reachability_learning.py is the automated code to run different reachability calculation algorithms.
